== Installation ==

1. Upload `add-to-any-subscribe` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Presentation` -> `Widgets` and click `Add` next to "Add to Any Subscribe"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is the list of services updated? =

Constantly.

= Where can I choose which button to display and other options? =

Go to `Settings` > `Subscribe Buttons`. 

= How come the widget doesn't display once I activate it? =

You'll have to manually put it where you want it in your sidebar.  You can do so by going to `Presentation` > `Widgets` and clicking `Add` next to "Add to Any Subscribe".  You'll need to have a "widget ready" theme.

If you have already added the widget but the actual button is not displaying, you should reinstall the widget, making sure to copy the actual `add-to-any-subscribe` folder (and all of its contents) to your plugins folder.

Also, be sure to deactivate any previous versions of the widget in the `Plugins` tab.

= What if I don't have a "widget ready" theme, or I want to place the button somewhere else? =

Using the Theme Editor, you can place the following code in your template pages (within sidebar.php, index.php, single.php, and/or page.php):

`&lt;?php Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget::display(); ?&gt;`

= Why do embedded objects (like Flash) disappear when the menu is displayed? =

This is done to overcome browser limitations that prevent the drop-down menu from displaying on top of intersecting embedded objects.  If you would like to disable this, uncheck the `Hide embedded objects (Flash, video, etc.) that intersect with the menu when displayed` option on the plugin's settings page.
