Forever.

= How often is the list of services updated? =

Sometimes you'll have to manually put it where you want it in your sidebar.  You can do so by going to `Presentation` > `Widgets` and dragging the widget onto the sidebar.  You'll need to have a "widget ready" theme.

Also, be sure to deactivate any previous versions of the widget in `Plugins` tab.
