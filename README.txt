== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long will this service be around? =

Forever.

= How often is the list of services updated? =

Constantly.

= Where can I choose which button to display and other options? =

Go to `Presentation` > `Widgets`.  Under `Current Widgets`, look for "Add to Any Subscribe", and click `Edit`.

= How come the widget doesn't display once I activate it? =

You'll have to manually put it where you want it in your sidebar.  You can do so by going to `Presentation` > `Widgets` and clicking `Add` next to "Add to Any Subscribe".  You'll need to have a "widget ready" theme.

If you have already added the widget but the actual button is not displaying, you should reinstall the widget, making sure to copy the actual `add-to-any-subscribe` folder (and all of its contents) to your plugins folder.

Also, be sure to deactivate any previous versions of the widget in the `Plugins` tab.
